# Blood Donation Management System

# Project Description
The blood donation management system is created for the purpose of practicing building databases, SQL queries (and maybe more advanced things like stored procedures, triggers, etc.), web service APIs to pull data from the database, and test cases. 
The project idea came from [https://hackr.io/blog/best-sql-projects]. I also referenced [https://www.labouseur.com/courses/db/projects/red-cross.pdf] for ERD and queries examples, and to understand what data is needed for a successful blood donation database. 
Currently, I am using Microsoft SQL Server as my RDBMS, and Transaction SQL (T-SQL) to write queries. I chose them because it was free and T-SQL is the subset of SQL the management system uses. I am going to use Java, mainly, to write the web service APIs.
